# Sarctiann NVIM setup
### Based ðŸ’¤ [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
Please refer to the lazyvim [documentation] (https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) for a deeper understanding or if you want to start your own setup.

---

I'm a vscode user coming to neovim, so Lazyvim has a great balance between what I know and what I want to change in terms of my workflow.

On the other hand, I am a user of macos and Linux distributions, so I have a great affinity and affection for the Terminal, and the Terminal interfaces.

Depending on how identified you feel with this brief description you could:

0. Continue with vscode

1..3. Try raw neovim

4..9. Test a neovim distribution:
    * Lazyvim (this one)
    * LunarVim
    * NeoChad
    * among other...

10. Try this setup.

With this configuration I try to have a fairly intuitive way of doing what I was already doing in vscode, but with all the flavor of a good TUI.
